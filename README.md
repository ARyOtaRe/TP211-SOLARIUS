# TP211-SOLARIUS






This repository will centralize all the data regarding the project we have between computer science class and mechanical science class, where we have to make a solar panel act like a sunflower, a.k.a. follow the path of the sun during the day (to get a maximum efficiency) and return to its original position throughout the night.
