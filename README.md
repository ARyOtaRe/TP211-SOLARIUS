# TP211-SOLARIUS

This project was made by a collaboration of our computer science class and mechanical science class, where we had to conceptualise and produce a solar panel act like a sunflower, a.k.a. follow the path of the sun during the day (to get a maximum efficiency) and return to its original position throughout the night.
